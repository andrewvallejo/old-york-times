## <div align=center> My Story </div>

Hi, I'm Andrew! I did this project as a practice 'take-home' skill test for Mod 4 of Turing. I was inspired to making a digital newspaper to be seen as an art piece! Due to the limits of time, this idea was not realized as of yet (9/24/2021).  

--- 
**Learning goals:**  My biggest learning goal (which I did not get to unfortuantely) was to emulate Jen Simmons' [Mondrian Grid](https://labs.jensimmons.com/2017/01-011C.html) , but with newspaper articles! Its funny since she suggested in her video this would be practical for a NYT website. Still, I wanted to learn how to do this! 

My small goals were to learn an a layer of complexity to how my components are ordered. I wanted each page to have its own 'hub' component, so the logic flows from App -> Page -> Components, where most of the data lives inside of Page. 

Also, to create a responsive website without relying on media queries.

**Challenges:** The CSS was surprisingly hard for this one. No media queries added some difficulty since the objective was new. I relied on clamp for most of it. I used one media query to hide / reveal elements at certain widths. I dont have very much experience in grid so I was only able to achieve a 'cleanish' layout but not the layout that I wanted.
